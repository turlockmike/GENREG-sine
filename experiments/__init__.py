GENREG Experiments

All experiments should report three standard metrics:
- MSE: Accuracy (lower is better)
- Energy: Inference cost (lower is better)
- Saturation: Percentage of saturated neurons

Use core.metrics.compute_metrics() for consistent measurement.
Use core.training.train_sa() or train_hillclimb() for training.
